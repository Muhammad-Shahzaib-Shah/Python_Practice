A public reminder to myself: show up, code, improve — repeat. This repo tracks my daily Python journey, from basics to advanced concepts. Every commit is a step forward, every script is a win, every day counts. /n
👨‍💻 Goal: Become better than yesterday 
🏆 Rule: No excuses. Code daily. 
📖 Motto: “Discipline creates developers.”
